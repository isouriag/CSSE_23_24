# Capita Selecta of Software Engineering (2023/2024)

The repository hosts the material, developed and needed in the lab-sessions of CSSE,
at VUB Brussels.

## Lab-Session 1 (21 November 2023)

This session will give a brief introduction to alternative libraries
used to represent and process data in MSR. We will discuss NumPy, Pandas, Spark, R (vectors), TensorFlow
and PyTorch. The PDF of the presentation can be found [here](session01/slides.pdf).

The second part will be a live demo of a basic data collection on a repository. The code
can be found [here](session01/src).


## Lab-Session 2 (upcoming, 5 December 2023)

Please **bring your laptop to lab-session 2** and ensure that the **code from lab-session 1 runs**.
We will extend the code during the session.

**The following is a draft.**

In the active part of session 2, you can follow up on some ideas. The previous code from session 1 can be used as a starting point.
- You can follow up on resolving the problem of **comment length**. Different length comments should be reflected in our metric on comments.
- You can follow up on code word **watermarks**. Not all comments matter. Some are repetitive and have no true meaning. You can develop a creative solution.
- You can follow up on providing other metrics that **explain** the degree of how commented a class is. Taking a look at access modifications is a suitable option. Do you have other ideas?
