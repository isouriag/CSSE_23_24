# Capita Selecta of Software Engineering (2023/2024)

The repository hosts the material, developed and needed in the lab-sessions of CSSE,
at VUB Brussels.

## Lab-Session 1 (21 November, 2023)

This session will give a brief introduction to alternative libraries
used to represent and process data in MSR. We will discuss numpy, pandas, spark, R (vectors), tensorflow
and pytorch. The PDF of the presentation can be found here (after the lecture).

The second part will be a live demo of a basic data collection on a repository. The code
can be found [here](session01/src).
